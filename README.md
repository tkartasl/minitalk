ðŸš€ About the Project

The Minitalk project is part of the Hive Helsinki coding schools curriculum and focuses on Unix signals, inter-process communication (IPC), and low-level programming concepts in C. The goal is to create a simple client-server communication system using only Unix signals (`SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2`).

âœ¨ Features

- **Client Program:** Sends a string message to the server.
- **Server Program:** Receives the message, character by character, and displays it.
- **Signal Handling:** Uses `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2` for communication.
- **Error Handling:** Ensures proper operation and detects common IPC issues.
